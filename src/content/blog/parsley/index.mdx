## What is Parsley?

Parsley is a popular herb commonly used in cooking and as a garnish. It is known for its bright green leaves and delicate, fresh flavor that is often described as slightly bitter and slightly citrusy. Parsley is a versatile herb that can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, sauces, stews, salads, and more. In addition to its culinary uses, parsley has a long history of use in traditional medicine and is believed to have a number of health benefits, including helping to improve digestion, reduce inflammation, and boost the immune system

## Types of Parsley

There are two main types of parsley: flat-leaf (Italian) parsley and curly parsley.

1. Flat-leaf (Italian) parsley: Also known as Italian parsley, this variety is characterized by its flat, dark green leaves and stronger, more robust flavor than curly parsley. It is more commonly used in cooking and is considered to be the more versatile of the two varieties.

2. Curly parsley: This variety is characterized by its tightly curled leaves and milder flavor. It is often used as a garnish or in decorative dishes, but can also be used in cooking, particularly in soups and stews. Curly parsley is often considered to be less flavorful than flat-leaf parsley and is less commonly used in cooking.

There are also other less common types of parsley, such as Hamburg parsley and root parsley, which are used for their roots rather than their leaves.

## Usage

For the most part, parsley leaves, finely chopped, are added shortly before service to flavor salads, soups, vegetables, fish, and meat dishes. They are also added to herb butter. The roots and stems are cooked in stocks, soups, vegetable and meat casseroles.
