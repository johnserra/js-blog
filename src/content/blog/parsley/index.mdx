## What is Parsley?

Parsley is a popular herb commonly used in cooking and as a garnish. It is known for its bright green leaves and delicate, fresh flavor that is often described as slightly bitter and slightly citrusy. Parsley is a versatile herb that can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, sauces, stews, salads, and more. It is also an important ingredient in many traditional recipes, such as chimichurri sauce and gremolata. In addition to its culinary uses, parsley has a long history of use in traditional medicine and is believed to have a number of health benefits, including helping to improve digestion, reduce inflammation, and boost the immune system

## Types of Parsley

Two main types of parsley are used in the kitchen: flat-leafed (Italian) parsley, which has more flavor; and curly parsley, which is excellent as a garnish. The sweet flavored roots and stems are as much valued as the leaves.
