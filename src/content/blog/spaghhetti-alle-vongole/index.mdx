Spaghetti Alle Vongole is one of my favorite dishes. I first tasted this dish back in the days when I was in Crotone while working on a yacht. It is such a simple dish, yet very elegant, and tastes wonderfully like the sea.

## Ingredients

* 500gr. Spaghetti
* 500gr. Vongole
* Olive Oil
* 2-3 Cloves of Garlic
* Rock Salt
* Red Pepper Flakes
* 1 Glass Dry White Wine
* A Bunch of Parsley

## Instructions

1. Boil plenty of water in a large pot.
2. Heat a generous ammount of olive oil in a pan.
3. Add the whole cloves of garlic in the heated olive oil.
4. Remove the cloves once they are nicely browned. Put them aside...
5. Add the vongole to the pan and stir them gently for about 15-20 seconds.
6. Add the glass of white wine and let it simmer.
7. Add a pinch of salt to the boiling water. Don't over do it. The fresh vongole will be salty from the sea.
8. Let vongole simmer until they begin to open. If they don't, they are not good to eat. Send to /dev/null :(
9. Add the spaghetti to the boiling water. Follow instructions on the package for time. I generally go for 6 or 7 minutes.
10. I strain the pasta usually a little early. I keep some of the water and then usually don't use it.
11. Dump the pasta over the vongole and mix it in gently. It will finish to cook... and soak up the delicious broth.
12. Once the spaghetti are nice and shiny and have absorbed the sauce, sprinkle roughly chopped parsley over it and mix in.

## Buon Apetito!
